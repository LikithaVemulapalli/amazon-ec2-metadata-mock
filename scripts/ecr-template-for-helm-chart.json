    "aboutText": "# Helm Chart for Amazon EC2 Metadata Mock\n\nAWS EC2 Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance. Instance metadata is divided into categories like hostname, instance id, maintenance events, spot instance action. The instance metadata can be accessed from within the instance. Some instance metadata is available only when an instance is affected by the event.\n\nThis project attempts to bridge the gaps by providing mocks for most of these metadata categories. The mock responses are designed to replicate those from the actual instance metadata service for accurate, local testing.\n\nThis repository contains helm-charts for Amazon EC2 Metadata Mock.\n\nFor more information on this project, see the project repo at [Amazon EC2 Metadata Mock](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ec2-metadata-mock)",
